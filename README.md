# 🚖 Uber Supply-Demand Gap Analysis

This project explores the mismatch between ride requests and trip fulfillment on the Uber platform. Through data analysis, visualization, and business insights, we uncover key problem areas and propose data-driven solutions to bridge the supply-demand gap.

---

## 📊 Project Objective

- Identify **when and where** Uber fails to fulfill ride requests
- Understand causes: **Cancellations** vs **No Cars Available**
- Recommend **operational and strategic solutions** to improve fulfillment rates

---

## 📁 Dataset

**File:** `Cleaned_Uber_Request_Data.xlsx`  
- Request Timestamp  
- Pickup Point (City / Airport)  
- Driver ID  
- Status (Trip Completed, Cancelled, No Cars Available)  
- Drop Timestamp

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **SQL** for querying data patterns
- **Excel** for quick data inspection
- **PowerPoint** for insights presentation

---

## 📈 Key Visualizations

1. **Hourly Request Status Breakdown**
2. **Fulfillment Rate by Hour**
3. **Unfulfilled Requests by Hour**
4. **Pickup Point vs Request Status**
5. [Optional] Daypart and Zone-Based Trends

---

## 🔍 Insights

- Fulfillment rate drops significantly at **5–9 AM** and **11 PM–3 AM**
- **Airport pickups** suffer more from **No Cars Available** at night
- **City pickups** see more **Cancellations** early morning
- These failures are **predictable and fixable**

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations

- Time-based driver **incentives** (Rush Hour / Night Bonuses)
- **Zone-based supply planning** (Airport at night, City in morning)
- **Promo recovery** for affected riders to reduce churn
- **Demand forecasting dashboards** to proactively allocate drivers
